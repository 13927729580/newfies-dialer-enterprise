Newfies-Dialer is a Voice and SMS broadcasting system based on distributed
message passing. It has been built to support cloud based servers and can
also work on standalone servers. It uses `Freeswitch`_ (VoIP Server) to
outbound calls.

Using very simple steps, Newfies-Dialer will help you create campaigns, add
phonebooks, contacts, build audio messages and create complex telephony
applications. Once the campaigns are ready to start, the messages
will be dispatched and delivered.

Newfies-Dialer provides an extensive set of APIs to easily integrate with
third-party applications. Virtually every feature on the UI can be managed
via the API's.
