The contact can contain extra custom data in the Additional Parameters field. This is JSON formatted data that can be used for tag replacement in the survey when using TTS, e.g.

::

{"age": "32"}


When {age} is used in the TTS script in a survey node, it will read out 32 instead.

There are some special variables which have certain functions. These are described in the documentation.

.. _import_contacts:

Import Contacts
---------------

To import bulk contacts into a phonebook, click on `Import` where you can upload contacts via a CSV file under a logged in
user's phonebook.

There are two import modes, the default is a simple import where only the telephone numbers need uploading. Simply create a text file with your list of numbers, 'Choose File' from the interface, and upload.

The advanced mode should be used when other contact details have to be uploaded such as name, address and additional JSON parameters.

**URL**:

    * http://HOSTNAME_IP/contact_import/

Use the pipe "|" as the field delimiter, e.g.
::

    1234567890|surname|forename|email@somewhere.com|test-contact|1|address|city|state|US|unit|{"age":"32","title":"doctor"}|

The file needs to contain all the pipes, even if you don't want to populate all the fields. e.g.

::

    12024648397|||||1|||||||||

Often, it is easier to copy a correctly formatted column from Excel and paste it into a text file. The formula to convert a telephone number in column A into the required format in column B uses concatenation, and is as follows:

::

        =A2&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"1|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"&"|"


.. _additional_parameters:

Additional parameters (JSON)
----------------------------

In contacts, under advanced data, it is possible to upload custom values which can be played as TTS simply by enclosing them in {curly brackets} in the following form:

::

    {"age": "32"}

If {age} is placed into the TTS, 32 will be the value read out. Multiple JSON formatted values can be added into this field

.. _special_function_additional_parameters_keywords:

Special Function Additional parameters keywords (JSON)
------------------------------------------------------

Some special function keywords can be added which change the usual behaviour of the system. These are:

**transfer_phonenumber** - the value of the transfer phone number overwrites the SIP URI / Phone number in the call transfer node.

**transfer_ref** - this means that a SIP header "P-Contact-Transfer-Ref" is added on transfer, which may be used to trigger a screen pop or otherwise identify the contact transferred at your IP-PBX.

**sms_phonenumber** - when the SMS node is used, rather than sending the SMS to the contact's number, it can be sent to a different number, e.g. the contact's cellphone number, if this keyword is used.
