Configuration Overview
----------------------

When a Newfies-Dialer system is first commissioned, much of this work will be done as part of the commissioning process by the Newfies-Dialer team. However, it may be necessary for Newfies-Dialer admin to add new gateways or make other changes to the system.

The commissioning process will include:

* **Freeswitch configuration** - setting up the gateways which Newfies-Dialer will use
* **Site configuration** - Setting up the host name
* **Text to speech**  - configuring TTS engines
* SMS configuration

Tasks which will be performed by Newfies-Dialer admin, with our training, will include:

* Adding new users
* Creating Dialer settings, which control the resources any one user can consume
* Site configuration and editing the home page
