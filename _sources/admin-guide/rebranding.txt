Rebranding and logo upload will be done by the Newfies-Dialer support team, simply provide us with the Company Name, a logo as described below, and your favicon, as described below.

Configure project names and footer
----------------------------------

Edit /usr/share/newfies/newfies_dialer/settings_local.py as follows::

    # BRANDING
    # ========
    PROJECT_NAME = 'MyCompany'
    PAGE_FOOTER = 'Powered by MyCompany'


Change Icon
-----------

The icon needs to be in PNG format and have transparency.
Max height for the icon is 60px.

Copy it in the `images/branding` directory::

    cp mycompany-icon.png /usr/share/newfies/resources/images/branding/logo-icon.png


Change Favicon
--------------

You will need 3 files:
* apple-touch-icon.png
* favicon.ico
* favicon.png

Copy those files to the `images/branding` directory::

    cp apple-touch-icon.png /usr/share/newfies/resources/images/branding/
    cp favicon.* /usr/share/newfies/resources/images/branding/


Custom CSS
----------

Copy `custom.css` to the `css/branding` directory::

    cp custom.css /usr/share/newfies/resources/css/branding/


Apply changes
-------------

You will need to collect the new static files and restart supervisor::

    workon newfies-dialer
    cd /usr/share/newfies
    python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    resup
