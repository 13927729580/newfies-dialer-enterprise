.. _faq-how-does-tag-substitution-work:

How does the tag substitution work with the TTS engine
------------------------------------------------------

**Answer:**

This is the list of standard tags that will be automatically replaced:
    {last_name}
    {first_name}
    {email}
    {country}
    {city}
    {contact}  // This is the phone number

If you need more flexibility, you can use the "Additional Parameters (JSON)" field which allow you to add custom key-values that will be replaced.

For example, let's add this in "Additional Parameters (JSON)":
    {"company_name": "Canonical", "bonus" : "200", "currency" : "euro"}

When you create a survey with a node that plays TTS, you can easily replace the key-values in the text.
Text example:

    "We are calling you on behalf of {company_name}, you receive a bonus of {bonus} {currency}"


.. _faq-how-provide-tts-in-multiple-languages:

How does Newfies-Dialer provide TTS in multiple languages
---------------------------------------------------------

**Answer:**

By default the TTS engine used by newfies-Dialer is Flite (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/)
which only supports English. If you want to use another language you will need another TTS engine.

We have integrated Acapela: http://acapela-vaas.com/ and in order to use Acapela,
the only thing you have to do is to sign in and enable Acapela on Newfies-dialer.


.. _faq-how-enable-acapela:

How to enable Acapela on Newfies-Dialer
---------------------------------------

**Answer:**

First you will have to sign-up and register an account with Acapela : http://acapela-vaas.com/
Once you signed up you will receive a login, an application login and an application password, you will need those to configure Acapela on Newfies-Dialer.

Acapela needs to be configured in 2 places:

1. On the Web interface

Edit the file /usr/share/newfies-dialer/newfies_dialer/settings_local.py and find::

    #TEXT-TO-SPEECH
    #==============
    TTS_ENGINE = 'FLITE'  # FLITE, CEPSTRAL, ACAPELA

    ACCOUNT_LOGIN = 'EVAL_XXXX'
    APPLICATION_LOGIN = 'EVAL_XXXXXXX'
    APPLICATION_PASSWORD = 'XXXXXXXX'

    SERVICE_URL = 'http://vaas.acapela-group.com/Services/Synthesizer'
    QUALITY = '22k'  # 22k, 8k, 8ka, 8kmu
    ACAPELA_GENDER = 'W'
    ACAPELA_INTONATION = 'NORMAL'

    You will have to change the value of the settings : TTS_ENGINE, ACCOUNT_LOGIN, APPLICATION_LOGIN and APPLICATION_PASSWORD.


2. On the IVR application

Create a new file /usr/share/newfies-lua/config/acapela_config.lua and add the following::

    TTS_ENGINE = 'acapela'

    ACCOUNT_LOGIN = 'EVAL_VAAS'
    APPLICATION_LOGIN = 'EVAL_XXXXXX'
    APPLICATION_PASSWORD = 'XXXXXX'

    SERVICE_URL = 'http://vaas.acapela-group.com/Services/Synthesizer'
    QUALITY = '22k'  -- 22k, 8k, 8ka, 8kmu
    ACAPELA_GENDER = 'M'
    ACAPELA_INTONATION = 'NORMAL'
    ACAPELA_LANG = 'EN'


    Change the value of the settings : ACCOUNT_LOGIN, APPLICATION_LOGIN, APPLICATION_PASSWORD and optionally, ACAPELA_LANG.


Finally restart the web UI:::

    /etc/init.d/supervisor stop
    and
    /etc/init.d/supervisor start

Dialer Logic
============

.. _faq-how-retry-works:

How does the dial retry logic works
-----------------------------------

**Answer:**

There are 2 systems available to retry calls:

Basic Retry:

    Basic retry checks to see if the call has been answered, even for a very
    short duration, this is regarded as a successful call. However if the call
    is not answered, busy or unreachable, it will be considered as a failed
    call, and will be retried as defined in the "Dialer Settings"  section in
    the campaign.


Completion Retry:

    This feature works with the survey editor. When a survey node is created,
    the "Survey Complete" checkbox can be ticked so that it is clear that the
    contact reached a certain point in the survey and did not abandon the
    call early.
    Usually, one of the last nodes in the survey is ticked as "Survey
    Complete".

    The Completion Retry interval and number of times to retry is set in the
    campaign under the "Dialer Completion Settings" section.
