Newfies-Dialer is a Voice and SMS broadcasting system based on distributed
message passing. It has been built to support cloud based servers and can
also work on standalone servers. It uses `Freeswitch`_ (VoIP Server) to
outbound calls.

Using very simple steps, Newfies-Dialer will help you create campaigns, add
phonebooks, contacts, build audio messages and create complex telephony
applications. Once the campaigns are ready to start, the messages
will be dispatched and delivered.

Newfies-Dialer provides an extensive set of APIs to easily integrate with
third-party applications. Virtually every feature on the UI can be managed
via the API's.

mass outbound calling, voice broadcasting or providing outbound IVR Some of the
potential uses for Newfies-Dialer are listed below.

.. _utility:

Utility
--------
Newfies-Dialer is loaded up with a list of telephone numbers that can be dialled
sequentially at very high rates of calling depending on carrier capacity and
hardware, potentially delivering many millions of calls per day.

When the called party answers the call, Newfies-Dialer passes the call to a telephony
application that is custom designed to provide the desired behaviour.

Some examples of where Newfies-Dialer may be used follow:


    * **Telecasting**: Broadcast marketing or informational messages to customers and clients.

    * **Phone Polling, Surveys and Voting**: Ring large numbers of people and present
      IVR options for either polling their opinions, interactive surveys, or taking
      their vote and record the results.

    * **Debt Control**: Customers can be automatically reminded at intervals that
      they owe money, and an IVR menu presented to talk to the finance department
      or passed to a credit card capture IVR to pay over the phone.

    * **Dissemination of information via phone**: Newfies-Dialer was originally
      designed to call large numbers of people and disseminate medical and health advice
      via cellphone in 3rd world countries where often, literacy levels are low. On a
      local scale, it can be used to disseminate information about forthcoming community events.

    * **Mass Emergency broadcast**: Where there is a necessity to warn large numbers
      of people in a short space of time, such as weather warnings, evacuation notices
      and crime prevention.

    * **Subscription Reminders and Renewals**: Where a company sells an annual
      subscription for a product or service, Newfies-Dialer can be configured to
      dial the customer, remind them that the subscription is due.

Server Specification for Newfies-Dialer
---------------------------------------

As a minimum, we recommend a server with 4Gb of RAM and at least 40Gb of hard
drive space with a 64 bit architecture. This will be sufficient to test
Newfies-Dialer. However, for best performance a highly specified server would
be better with good IO suggesting SSD, RAID 0 or RAID 10, plenty of RAM and
multiple processors.


The capacity of your Newfies-Dialer server can only be determined accurately
with benchmarking.

As a rule of thumb, if you are looking for more than 1000 concurrent calls,
then we would recommend a multi-server installation consisting of one database
and web server and multiple Freeswitch systems to make the calls.
