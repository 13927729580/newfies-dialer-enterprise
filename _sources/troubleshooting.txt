.. _find-log-files:

Where to find the log files
===========================

All the logs are centralized into one single directory **/var/log/newfies/**


**newfies-django-db.log** : This contains all the Database queries performed by the UI


**newfies-django.log** : All the logger events from Django


**err-apache-newfies.log** : Any apache errors pertaining to Newfies-Dialer


**celery-newfies-node1.log** : This contains celery activity

**newfieslua_logs_%%.log.log** : This contains the phone system logs


.. _config-files:

Where are located the config files
==================================

Newfies-Dialer configuration file is located by default at /usr/share/newfies-dialer/newfies_dialer/settings_local.py

`settings_local.py` contains all the local changes specific to your installation, this file is inherited from /usr/share/newfies-dialer/newfies_dialer/settings.py, therefore you can copy settings to settings_local.py and overwrite the default configuration.


.. _enable-debug:

Enable the debug
================

When you get a message "Server Error, You've encountered an error!", you might want
to enable the debugger to get a full traceback of the error.

To enable the debugger, edit the file /usr/share/newfies-dialer/newfies_dialer/settings_local.py and set those settings as follow::

    DEBUG = True
    TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

Note that you should be able to get the traceback in
**/var/log/newfies/err-apache-newfies.log**


.. _run-quick-test-call:

How to run a quick test call
============================

Go on the admin panel and check if there is any call request that has been spooled.

    * http://<SERVER-IP>/admin/dialer_cdr/callrequest/


If there are no calls queued, this means that the campaign is not properly configured.

You should:

    1. Check if the campaign is started that the "Start time", "Finish Time" and server time are correct.

    2. Make sure that you configured a Dialer Setting for the user running the campaign, although there will be a warning for this on the Customer UI : http://<SERVER-IP>/admin/dialer_settings/dialersetting/

If there is an existing Call Request, check the status, and check the Celery log stored in /var/log/newfies


.. _run-debug-mode:

Run in debug mode
=================

Make sure you stop the services first::

    $ /etc/init.d/newfies-celeryd stop


Then run in debug mode::

    $ workon newfies-dialer
    $ cd /usr/share/newfies/
    $ python manage.py celeryd -EB --loglevel=DEBUG


.. _celerymon:

Celerymon
=========

* https://github.com/ask/celerymon

Running the monitor :

Start celery with the --events option on, so celery sends events for celerymon to capture::
    $ workon newfies-dialer
    $ cd /usr/share/newfies/
    $ python manage.py celeryd -E


Run the monitor server:
::

    $ workon newfies-dialer
    $ cd /usr/share/newfies/
    $ python manage.py celerymon


However, in production you probably want to run the monitor in the background, as a daemon:
::

    $ workon newfies-dialer
    $ cd /usr/share/newfies/
    $ python manage.py celerymon --detach


For a complete listing of the command line arguments available, with a short
description, you can use the help command:
::

    $ workon newfies-dialer
    $ cd /usr/share/newfies/
    $ python manage.py help celerymon


Now you can visit the webserver celerymon starts by going to: http://localhost:8989


.. _step-by-step-checklist:
